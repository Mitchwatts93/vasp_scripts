# USAGE
########################################################################################################################

# calling intercalate_struct:
# from the command line, e.g.: python3 intercalate_struct.py Li 0.1
# the arguments after the file are: the metal to intercalate with, the amount of atoms to add as a fraction of the 
# number of atoms in the structure

# argparse will then use these to call the intercalation_routine function
# this will create a settings object and the intercalate object using these settings

# when the intercalate object initialises, it will try to find the POSCAR file and load it as a pymatgen structure
# it will then try to find a LOCPOT file, this is used to assess the best positions to use from Voronoi decomposition
# currently there is only support for orthogonal cells
# then any vacuum spaces will be identified, these interfere with the Voronoi decomposition so will be swapped out for 
# a default value found in the settings object. This is only temporary and is corrected after V. decomposition
# then the macrodensity package is used to interpret the LOCPOT file.
# interstitial sites are then found using pymatgen/voro++ Vornoi decomposition (looking for Voronoi vertices - can be 
# changed in settings object), Voronoi radii of these is also returned
# the vacuum is then reinserted, and a list of interstitial sites and V. radii created

# the intercalation_routine function will then continue, printing information to the terminal as it goes
# first small Voronoi vertices are removed (small is defined by the fraction of the intercalant atom in settings)
# then any sites outside of the structure are removed 
# then any sites within layers are removed. note the way this is done will only work for monoelemental structures 
# currently
# then the potential from the LOCPOT file in sphere of radius of  Vornoi radii around each Voronoi vertex is calculated
# (using spherical_potential function base don macrodensity cubic potential function)
# then all combinations of the remaining sites are found, with the number of combinations noted
# any combinations in which any two sites are too close together (see settings object) are removed
# then the expected number of combinations is calculated
# the combinations remaining are added to the original structure, resulting in a list of structures with different
# intercalation sites
# then a dictionary for each site is created with some useful information for later
# if the settings are set so, then the structures are sorted by the potential sum of intercalant sites from the 
# unintercalated LOCPOT file. the top n are then selected and all else thrown away
# then the ewald sum for all combinations is calculated, and the structures remaining are sorted by this ewald sum
# this will mean structure 0 should be the configuration with the ions furthest apart
# the user is then informed if the number of structures produced is as expected, note there is a small bug here,
# if you select the top n based on their potentials previously then the expected number will differ
# then all the structures are written out in POSCAR format
# a csv file is written with the information about each structure in, optionally the repr of the structure object
# can also be written

#TO DO
########################################################################################################################
#1 docstrings
#2 make some of the methods more general so they'll work for any material
#3 improve argparse so that it can take some user input for other settings
#4 clean user input before passing it anywhere

##5 additional options to reduce sites:
##    remove any sites with wildly different potentials??
##    remove any sites too close to the edges?
##    remove any structures with low potential sum?

####6 make the main class inherit all of Structure class, then don't need to call structure everytime, can just call 
self? Issues when attempting this quickly, try again

# fix small bugs
